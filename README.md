# My Portfolio Site

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio site. This is where you can see the source code and understand the structure of the project. If you'd like to run the project on your own machine, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <REPO_URL>
    ```

    > Replace `<REPO_URL>` with the URL of this repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-app
    ```

3. **Install Required Node Modules**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the Service**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the service, and if successful, it should automatically open your default web browser pointing to `localhost:3000`. If not, you can manually open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
